Introduction:
-------------
The Forum Agent is a module of Utopia Angel, for automatically posting
intel (CB, SoM, Survey and SoS) into external message boards. The
Forum Agent supports many message boards which are available on the
Internet, such as Avid Gamers, ezboard, vBulletin, phpBB, Invision
Board, and so on.

This document describes how to create your own API to interface with
the Forum Agent module, in order to collect its intel and store it in
your own database. We assume that you have adequate programming
knowledge and a suitable environment installed (web-server, scripting
language, database, etc).

To simplify things, sample scripts in various languages are included
to this package. However, it is still strongly recommended to fully
read the protocol specification beforehand.


Protocol Overview:
------------------
The Forum Agent Custom API Protocol ("the protocol") consists of 3
stages:

    1. HANDSHAKE
    2. LOGIN
    3. INTEL POSTING

These 3 stages are executed in minimum 2 HTTP requests, where the
HANDSHAKE is independent, and the LOGIN and the INTEL POSTING stages
are executed together.

The 3 stages will be referred to as "session" in this document.

All variables sent by the Forum Agent module to the server are sent
using the HTTP POST request, and are URL encoded as required by the
HTTP protocol.


1. HANDSHAKE
------------
The session begins with the client connecting to the server, trying to
figure out if the application running on the server is recognized as a
supported forum software or a valid custom API. A custom API should
identify itself by planting the following string anywhere on the result
page:

    [FORUM AGENT API]

NOTE: Case is important, and must appear exactly as written above.

TIP: You can "hide" the header string inside an HTML page by placing it
inside HTML comment tags; this way if a human user accesses the API
page on your server, you can provide him with instructions on how to
set up his Forum Agent module, while the Forum Agent itself will detect
the API header string and act accordingly.

Additionally, you can include Forum Agent Instructions at this stage.
As always, they are flexible and can appear anywhere on the page as
well.

The following Forum Agent instruction must be included:

    FORUMAGENT:api_engine_version="(integer)"

The following Forum Agent instructions are recommended to be included:

    FORUMAGENT:minimum_forum_agent_version="(integer)"
    FORUMAGENT:bulk_mode="(boolean)"

Consult the Forum Agent manual for more information about the Forum
Agent Instructions, or APPENDIX A for specific details on these 3
instructions.


2. LOGIN
--------
After a successful HANDSHAKE, the client returns to the server with
login information and the intel to post. The login stage includes the
following variables, as filled-in by the user in the Forum Agent Boards
Management section.

    username
    password
    forum_name
    forum_password

NOTE: The "forum_name" variable has no significance. The API may ignore
it, or use it in conjunction with the "alternative_forum_by_location"
instruction to identify the intel based on the kingdom location.

The server API should verify these variables and return the following
string if the login is successful:

    +LOGIN

Otherwise, if the login fails for any reason, the following string
should be returned:

    -LOGIN

In this case, you may include the failure reason, for example:

    -LOGIN Invalid username/password combination!

If the login fails, the script should exit immediately and stop
performing any additional operations. However, if the login is
successful, the script should process the intel, as described in the
next section.

If the login is successful, the server may send one or multiple cookies
to the client, which will be returned to it in each client request
during the session. If cookies are involved, the client will cease
sending the authentication variables ("username", "password",
"forum_name", "forum_password") in each request, and send the cookie(s)
instead.


3. POST INTEL
-------------
The Forum Agent module supports 2 methods of sending the intel to the
Custom API, determined by the "bulk_mode" instruction. If this
instruction is omitted, it is disabled by default.


*** BULK_MODE OFF ***

If "bulk_mode" is disabled, the client will begin sending each item
one-by-one, using the following variables:

    province  --> The province name (without location)
    kingdom   --> The kingdom number
    island    --> The island number
    title     --> The subject of the post
    data      --> The body of the post

If the storage is successful, the server should respond with any string
starting with "+", for example:

    +0

Otherwise, it should respond with any string starting with "-", for
example:

    -0

In this case, you may include the failure reason, in this format: "-",
followed by an optional number, followed by the failure reason. For
example:

    -0 The database is currently down, try again later!

NOTE: We used "0" as the optional number in this example, but in fact
you can omit the number altogether, or use any other number, as long as
"bulk_mode" is disabled.


*** BULK_MODE ON ***

If "bulk_mode" is enabled, the client will send all the intel in one
pass, using the following variable:

    bulk_data

This variable includes all the intel of all the provinces being sent to
the server. The data is separated by 2 delimiters:

    RECORD DELIMITER = ASCII character #30
    GROUP DELIMITER = ASCII character #29

The record elements are sent in the following order (<RD> represents
the RECORD delimiter):

    index <RD> province <RD> kingdom <RD> island <RD> forum_name <RD>
    title <RD> body

NOTE: The "forum_name" variable has no significance. The API may ignore
it, or use it in conjunction with the "alternative_forum_by_location"
instruction to identify the intel based on the kingdom location.

Multiple records are sent as follows (RECORD represents the record line
as described above; <GD> represents the GROUP delimiter):

    RECORD1 <GD> RECORD2 <GD> RECORD3 <GD>...

In this case, the response should be the combined results for all the
items, in the following format:

    +0
    +1
    +2
    -3
    -4
    +5

And so on. Failed results may include a reason:

    -3 Error connecting to database
    -4 Error processing this item

The results should be separated by a new line. New line is represented
by at least one carriage return character (ASCII #13, "\r") and/or at
least one linefeed character (ASCII #10, "\n").

Notice: Returning a negative response will keep the item in the
client's queue, resulting in this item being resent over and over again
in subsequent sessions, until a positive response is returned.
Therefore, if you are rejecting a specific intel and don't want it to
be resent, you should return a positive response.
