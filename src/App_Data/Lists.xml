      <item id="9" subject="Ideas from others" postedBy="funkybox" posted="2010-12-16 05:46:24" completed="false">I asked my kd (they have no idea that i program here aswell) what they thought about pimp and what they thought of the functionallity etc. Ill update this with the reflections that they provide:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- I set angel to auto export intel what i copy making it easy to use. Still need to manually copy ops into pimp though. Also pimp isnt as good as it use to be. There are a lot of errors and such.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- I had difficulty last age with getting my ops in. It never showed that i put greed on someone. Also the minus in front of the away army can be overlooked thus failing an attack because his armies are home. For the rest i like how it works and got a lot of second attacks in because of accurate intel. Which when i would have gotten it myself would not have been possible due to oversending because of inaccuracy.</item>
