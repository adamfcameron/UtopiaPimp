Utopia Guide: Thievery

You send your thieves, and the operation commences...

Early indications show that our operation was a stunning success.
Our thieves listen in on a report of Visitor Q (17:24)'s Military Elder... Military Affairs

Noble Lady Robin the Warrior, we have 6 generals available to lead our armies. One must always stay here to lead our forces in defense, but you may send the others out to combat at any time. Here is a list of our Generals' current activities and our military strength:

Military Effectiveness - Our military effectiveness is determined the wage rates of our armed forces. Higher wages can drive up productivity. Any changes to pay will take time to change our efficiency.

At this time, approximately 78.0% of our maximum population is allocated to non-peasant roles. Our wage rate is 160% of normal levels, and our military is functioning at 85.0% efficiency.

In addition, our military strength is affected by a number of other factors including buildings, honor, spells, and more. Our net military effectiveness is as follows:

Offensive Military Effectiveness: 139.1%
Defensive Military Effectiveness: 131.4%
Net Offensive Points at Home: 98,698
Net Defensive Points at Home: 80,460
