Lord Mepp the Warrior, I am in charge of the development of infrastructure within your province.
I offer to you information on our buildings, their efficiency, and a list of when our current projects will be completed.

Building Effectiveness - The structures we construct throughout our lands may or may not function at full capacity, depending on two major factors. First, people must work in the buildings to realize their full utility. Second, money invested in tools sciences can raise efficiency as well. Note that changes in employment require time to shift your building efficiency. Listed below are the net effects of each of our buildings, not including personality or racial bonuses.

Current Available Workers:	10,539
Current Available Jobs:	20,800
Building Efficiency:	95.2%
Workers Needed for Max Efficiency:	13,936

You will find that as we build more of certain building types, many new structures will be less effective. The Next 1% in parentheses below refers to the benefits of dedicating 1% more of your land to a particular building type.
