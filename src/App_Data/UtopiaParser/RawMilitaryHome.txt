Military Affairs

Sir Tech Master, we have 5 generals available to lead our armies. One must always stay here to lead our forces in defense, but you may send the others out to combat at any time. Here is a list of our Generals' current activities and our military strength:

Military Effectiveness - Our military effectiveness is determined the wage rates of our armed forces. Higher wages can drive up productivity. Any changes to pay will take time to change our efficiency.

At this time, approximately 63.0% of our maximum population is allocated to non-peasant roles. Our wage rate is 200% of normal levels, and our military is functioning at 107.6% efficiency.

In addition, our military strength is affected by a number of other factors including buildings, honor, spells, and more. Our net military effectiveness is as follows:

Offensive Military Effectiveness: 107.7%
Defensive Military Effectiveness: 107.6%
Net Offensive Points at Home: 731
Net Defensive Points at Home: 60,619
