MILITARY TRAINING
Military Advisor
Im a Nerd, you require a military presence to both defend your lands and conquer your enemies. A strong and sustainable military is the key to survival, so train your troops wisely.
If you feel our military is too large, you can also release troops back into the peasantry at any time, where they can work the land and raise families.
You can learn more about the options available in the guide and can check the status of military recruitment and training on the Military Advisor page.
