SCIENCE RESEARCH
Science Advisor
The Arts & Sciences are the heart and soul of our people and our lands. Mastering these fields is vital to making our people stronger, smarter, and more efficient. This allows us to grow in strength without growing in size. More details outlining the effects of research into the different sciences can be found in the guide and the Arts & Sciences Council page.

Science is obtained in two steps. Over time, you can spend money investing in books of knowledge. Once you have acquired these, you can research them into specific categories of knowledge. Additionally, we may learn science from others by raiding our enemies through the Learn Attack. Below, you may set your research rate for new books and allocate your books into science categories.
