Building Effectiveness

The structures we construct throughout our lands may or may not function at full capacity, depending on two major factors. First, people must work in the buildings to realize their full utility (each person is capable of performing 1.5 jobs). Second, money invested in tools sciences can raise efficiency as well. Note that changes in employment require time to shift your building efficiency. Listed below are the net effects of each of our buildings, not including personality or racial bonuses.
